### About Me
My name is Cheng Song.<br/>
I'm from Ningbo, China, living in Beijing. I'm a undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University. <br/>
I have a keen interest in computer systems, large language models, embodied intelligence, and related fields. I love exploring the underlying logic behind code and algorithms, and I'm also eager to try my hand at multidisciplinary projects.<br/>
Outside of tech, I'm passionate about sports-especially running and table tennis-and enjoy music as well. Feel free to reach out; I'm always open to connecting with others!
